# Ease Frame

A web-based editor which exports configurations for the [ease-frame-runtime](https://github.com/abcnews/ease-frame-runtime/)

The latest release should be accessible via:

[`https://www.abc.net.au/res/sites/news-projects/ease-frame/latest/`](https://www.abc.net.au/res/sites/news-projects/ease-frame/latest/)

## Developing

Note: As the `latest` release is deployed to the same URL, we need to manually cache-bust that URL.
